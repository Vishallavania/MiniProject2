"SYSTEM FOR  MONITORING &amp; DETECTING COLLISIONS"

This project aims for designing and executing the system for Monitoring and Detecting the collisions occurring on roads. Currently we don’t have any automated system which can detect collisions and further monitor them. This proposed project gives solution for road side collisions and also the very first system that helps in detecting collisions and monitors them. This can be achieved by sensing a vehicle using an Ultrasonic sensor and a heat and sound sensor for sensing the collision if it occurs. Upon sensing the value above the sensor’s threshold then the data will be transmitted to the Raspberry Pi which will further trigger the Pi Camera to click the image of the suspected collision and Raspberry Pi will send the data about the collision to the Dynamic Database i.e. Firebase etc. Then the data sent to the database will be fetched from there into the Customized Android App which can be used by the alert stations i.e. nearest police station, fire brigade and an ambulance driver so that they can reach the place where collision occurred with the minimum time for formalities i.e. filling a report, hospital needs the confirmation from police during police case etc. Also this App will provide the police stations to file temporary FRI for the alerts received on the App with the mandatory data required will filing FIR and also any user can keep track of the investigation of the collision cases for which alerts they have received.

This project “IoT Based System for Monitoring & Detecting Collisions” is a cost effective, practical and reliable. It clearly tackles the two problems that our country is facing today that are roadside collisions and automating our alert stations, very efficiently.
